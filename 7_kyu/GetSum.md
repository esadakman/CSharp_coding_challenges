## Beginner Series #3 Sum of Numbers

- Given two integers `a` and `b`, which can be positive or negative, find the sum of all the integers between and including them and return it. If the two numbers are equal return a or b.

Note: `a` and `b` are not ordered!

Examples (`a`, `b`) --> output (explanation)

```CSharp
    (1, 0) --> 1 (1 + 0 = 1)
    (1, 2) --> 3 (1 + 2 = 3)
    (0, 1) --> 1 (0 + 1 = 1)
    (1, 1) --> 1 (1 since both are same)
    (-1, 0) --> -1 (-1 + 0 = -1)
    (-1, 2) --> 2 (-1 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 2)
```

Solution:

```CSharp
using System;
public class Sum
{
   public int GetSum(int a, int b)
   {
   var result = 0;
        for (var i = Math.Min(a, b); i <= Math.Max(a, b); i++)
      {
        result += i;
      }
        return result;
   }
}
```
